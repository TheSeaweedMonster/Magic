# Magic

That's how this script works.

Anyways, thanks to a long list of contributors and enthusiastic people wanting this script, I've tweaked it and put it back on github. Paste "executescript.lua" into the CE lua engine (any version of CE should work). It will automatically attach to the correct process and run the script.

You can run any script at the click of a button, undetected! (apart from some tiny memory allocations)! Enjoy.

This is for educational purposes of course
